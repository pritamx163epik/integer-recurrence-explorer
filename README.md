## üìñ Description
Integer Recurrence Explorer lets you explore classic and algorithmic integer sequences in an interactive way. You can pick a recurrence relation, set initial conditions and parameters, choose output length, and how to handle the range. After generating the terms, you can easily copy or download them. This project is a lightweight Angular single-page app, designed to run smoothly in any web browser. It can also be installed as a basic Progressive Web App (PWA) for more convenience.
